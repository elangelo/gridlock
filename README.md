# gridlock

**Assisted tiling with any compositing X11 window manager**

**Caveat emptor:** This small tool uses RGBA visuals and therefore requires a
               compositing window manager.

Tile windows of your congested desktop onto a static grid. This tool should
be started by a hotkey or (additional) mouse button of your choice. When
activated, the currently active window can be moved and resized using a static
grid. If your window manager does not allow to bind gridlock to your choice of
hotkey or mouse button, you may want to take a look at
[xbindkeys(1)](https://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/).

TODO:
- [X] Put this on github
- [ ] Prevent gridlock being launched more than once (yuck!)
- [X] Allow custom grid rows/columns
- [X] Allow custom colors and opacity
- [X] More compatibility with sidebars and reserved spaces
- [ ] Live preview of resized window?
- [ ] Daemon mode to get rid of `xbindkeys`?
- [ ] More eye candy?
- [ ] Fallback mode if no compositor?

## Requirements

Gridlock is implemented in Python 3 and uses the introspection based APIs of
GTK+ 3, GDK, Cairo and Wnck. Tested with:
- Python 3.10.8
- Gtk-3.24.34
- Cairo-1.16.0
- libwnck-43.0

## Motivation

After trying countless stacking, tiling and compositing window managers
(and hybrid ones) I still am not entirely happy with the different
appraches to window handling. Gridlock was inspired by a short discussion
on the xfce4-dev mailing list and obviously, by [windowgrid](http://windowgrid.net/).
